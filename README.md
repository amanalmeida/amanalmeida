### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
My name is Jona Brown, and this is a project that I created for Aman Almeida - a Musician who currently lives in the Seattle Area.

Concept:
I decided to use a dedicated color pallette of orange, dark grey and white for the design. Keeping a minimalist design was also key for this project, so I made the decision to use a lot of space frequently between the different types of information.

HTML:
There are four sections 
CSS:
I used a combination of grid and flex view for each of the different pages. Grid was only used for the "About Me" section as it was conventient to place each of the descriptions in their own squares within the grid. I used a few different keyframe animations, mainly for toggling the sidebar menu and for slightly scaling the picture outward.

JavaScript:
The first function displays the body tag of our html after 2000 milliseconds. The second and third function toggles the hamburger menu by opening and closing with the "click" event listener for both the menu and hamburger menu portion. The last portion of JS deals with submitting form data with Formspree to receive emails. It functions by posting the data written in the form field of index.html.

There was a lot to learn from this project, and was my first website. Please provide me with any feedback if you have any.
